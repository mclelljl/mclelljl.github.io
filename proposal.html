	<h1>Downtown Harrisonburg's Clothing Store</h1>
	<h4>Overview:</h4>
	<p>For this project, I will be revisiting my SMAD 203 User Experience Design project about Downtown Harrisonburg’s Clothing stores. My original design question I considered was “How might we improve the experience of JMU students trying to discover clothing stores in downtown Harrisonburg?”, using this design question, I will elaborate on my original work which included the bare minimum of user research. As I continue to work on this I will expand on the user research with a primary design question, research questions, an executive summary, a hypothesis for my design solution, new and more in depth interviews, new user personas, and user requirements, as well as a new wireframe, and screenshots of competing websites. I will also create high-fidelity prototypes for the app on Adobe XD with 5 pages from the app and a published walk through.</p>
	
	<h4>Audience:</h4>
	<p>My audience for this app will be JMU students. The app focuses on students who are not familiar with the Harrisonburg area and are looking for places to go shopping for clothes. The primary age group of these people range from 18-23. The audience includes both male and females as well as the “outdoorsy” type as well as people looking for more formal clothing.</p>
